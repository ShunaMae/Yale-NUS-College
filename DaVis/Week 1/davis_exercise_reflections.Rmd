# Task 1

**Find an example of (good or bad) data visualisation in the media.**

STUDENTS: EDIT THE FOLLOWING TEXT. ALSO CHANGE YOUR NAMES ON LINE 3 OF THIS
FILE.

We find the following figure an outstanding example of data visualisation.
The figure is from <https://michaelgastner.com/DAVisR_data/davis_logo.png>,
a timeless masterpiece of web design.
Although scholars are uncertain about the nature of the data represented, the
figure has become a classic example of abstract data visualisation.

STUDENTS: ON THE NEXT LINE, YOU MAY NEED TO ADJUST `out.width`.

```{r example_of_visualisation, out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://michaelgastner.com/DAVisR_data/davis_logo.png")
```


# Task 2

**Explain what you like or dislike about the figure.**

STUDENTS: GIVE YOUR ANSWERS IN THE FORM OF A BULLETED LIST FOLLOWING THE
EXAMPLE BELOW.

We like the following features of the figure:

- Data are represented as colourful bars with letters virtually dancing on
  top of each bar.
- The uneven lengths of the bars give this figure a dynamic, joyful
  appearance.
- Nobody in their right mind can look at this image without being instantly
  struck by intense optimism and cheerfulness.

What is there to dislike?

- Nothing
- Nichts
- Nada


# Task 3

**How would you improve the presentation of the data?**

Narrow-minded critics have raised concerns about the stark colour contrasts
between the bars.
We could not disagree more.
Upon careful inspection, colours were thoughtfully chosen to follow
the print-friendly quantitative palette Set1 from <https://colorbrewer2.org/>.

Our only minor suggestion to the graphic designer pertains to the pattern of
light gray rectangles in the background, which give the image the slightly
sterile atmosphere of bathroom tiles in a hospital.
Replacing the rectangular white lines by wavy lines would more effectively
communicate that DAVis will be a joyous ride for all students enrolled.
