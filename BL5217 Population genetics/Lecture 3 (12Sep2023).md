## Population Genetics 

- locus can be a stretch in the genome, or a single nucleotide 

#### Haplotypes

- ambiguity code ... ex. R = A or G 
- haploptypes are one of the strand in the DNA 

- nuclear ... 3.6 Gb (billion base pair)
- mitochondrial ...haploid (maternal) so is easier to test, 16kb

#### Linkage disequilibrium 

non-random association of alleles across loci at a higher or lower frequency than expectd from their total frequency 

- because two loci are close to each other, they are more likley to be inherited together...linkage 
- disequilibrium means that the loci are linked, inbalanced because they are not ramdomly distributed

- its usually physical but can be a functional linkage (far way but still linked)

- recombination disrupts the linkage 
- recombination is unifor across the chromosomes, at the middle the snippets will be shorter
- usually extends about 40-60 kb either side of a nucleotide position 
- LD is much higher in Europeans than in Africans 

#### Genetic Hitchhiking 

- when one locus is selected, other loci that are physically linked are also selected 

### Marker 

#### nDNA
- nuclear DNA has much slower diverging rate compared to mtDNA 
- because nDNA is diploid 
- in practical settings, useless because we see no change between individuals 

#### Organelle Sequence markers 
- lower population size (1/2), so evolve faster than nDNA 
- cyt-b
- NADH (ND2) 
- Barcoding gene (COI) 
- all are about 1kb and there are 16 of them 
- MtDNA control region is non-coding and has 2-6 itimes higher evolutionary rate than coding genes, so its most widely used mtDNA marker in Pop-Gen 
- for Phylogenetics, MtDNA control region is too fast 

##### Advantages 
- no recombination 
- reduce computational complexity 
- rapid evolution 
##### Disadvantages 
- limited to one ancestor (mom of mom of mom...)
- not a neutral genetic marker 
- in Pop Gen, we focus on neutral marker that are not under selection pressure. Subject to frequent selective sweeps 


#### RAPDs 
Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA 
- PCR-like reaction with random primers 
- simple gel band comparisons; no sequencing required 
- diff to distinguish between hetero vs homo zygorousity 
- poor reproducibility 

#### Microsatellites 
still widely used technique
- 2-5bp repeats (junk DNA, short tandem repeats) 
- the number of repeats is so fine that even family members can be distinguished given sufficient amount of microsatellites 
- development of primers for suitable microsatellites loci is tedious and costly 
- mutations in primer site may lead to null alleles or partial nulls 
- due to their diversity, it has low levels of population differentiation 


### Genetic measures 

genetic diversity (within a population) vs genetic differentiation (between populations)
- for evolutionary potentials, higher genetic diversity is preferred 

1. Number of Variable Sites (S)
2. Nucleotide Diversity ($\pi$) ... degree of polymorphism in a population 
3. Expected Heterozygosity ($\text{HE}$)  
4. Inbreeding coefficient ($\text{F_{\text{IS}}}$) ... the higher the coefficient, the less diverse the population 

#### Genetic differentiation 

##### Dxy: simple sequence divergence 
- genetic distance between species x and species y (Dxy). generally 2~3% are already different species. what percentage of loci are different? 

##### F-statics (Fixation Index)
- different in shape in pop A and B -> Fst of 1 because they are different between pops but same within pops 
- differece in everything in popA and B gives Fst of 0.11 because within the pop also diff 

1. Africans vs Mongolians ... same Dxy but low Fst because Mongolians are very homogenious 
2. Africans vs Chinese ... same Dxy and high Fst because Chinese are diverse
