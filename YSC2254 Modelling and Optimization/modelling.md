### Introduction 




## Situation 

I have 8 tasks to complete by the submission date of my Capstone Project. 

  1. Analysis Challenge: due in 4 days, requires 5 hours of work. 
  2. Presentation Slides Submission: due in 6 days, requires 6 hours of work. 
  3. Presentation Prep: due in 6 days, requires 2 hours of work. Must start after task 2. 
  4. Modelling Project 3: requires 7 hours of work. 
  5. Lab report individual part: due in 3 days, must start after task 7. Requires 2 hours of work. 
  6. Lab report group part: due in 5 days, must start after task 5. Requires 5 hours of work. 
  7. Capstone meeting prep: due in 2 days, Requires 10 hours of work. 
  8. Capstone Submission: due in 7 days. Requires 30 hours of work. Must start after task 7. 

I have a daily workload of 10 hours, and I want to allocate my time each day to complete the assignments while minimizing the total amount of time I spend working each day. 

## Formulation 

not doing more than 2 tasks per day 
to find the feasible region 

set pseudo objective function 

check FME 

$x_{ij}$, where $i$ denotes the days and $j$ denotes the task 0, 1 variable 


that branches out 

Solution 

Let's work out the constraints first. 
1. x_{11} + x_{12} + x_{13} + x_{14}
