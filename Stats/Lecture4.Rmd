##### World bank

the file _worldbank.tsv_ contains lots of information on different statistics associated with different countries ... lets load this into R

```{r}
worldbank = read.delim("worldbank.tsv", sep='\t')
```

lets make a histogram of the population growth .... 

```{r}

```

OK - how about making a boxplot of Population_growth - separating countries by their Climate Region?

```{r}

```

what about a scatter plot of  Population_growth - separating countries by their Climate Region?

```{r}
?stripchart

```

what about a violin plot of Population_growth - separating countries by Climate Region? 

```{r, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
library(vioplot)


```

Plot the cumulative frequency distribution of Population_growth 

```{r}
?ecdf
```


```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
